### PCB

This PCB design was created with KiCad, and has been [shared on OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/XcWQiX7z).
There are also gerber files available in the [output/gerber/](output/gerber/) directory.
This design is meant to be attached to the bottom of a ~12mm Piezo Buzzer, where the SMD parts are first soldered to the board, and are underneath the buzzer.
There are through-holes for the two probe connections, and pads on the back for the battery connections.
2x LR44 battery cells in series would pair nicely with this PCB, as they are a good voltage match, and are approximately the same diameter
(meaning the whole thing can be heat shrunk together for a miniature continuity tester).
