### PCB

This PCB design was created with KiCad, and has been [shared on OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/1CFwpMAd).
There are also gerber files available in the [output/gerber/](output/gerber/) directory, or [gerber.zip](output/gerber.zip).

Attach a ~12mm Piezo Buzzer to the end. PMS150C, PMS15A, and PMS171B require an Active (on/off) buzzer.  PFS154, PFS173, PMS152, and PMS154C use a Passive (PWM) buzzer.

Attach a CR1225 (or CR1220, CR1025, CR927, etc...) to the bottom after soldering a wire to hold it (and act as the positive contact).
